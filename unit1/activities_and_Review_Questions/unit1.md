2. Explore the concepts of domain and sub domain. What options are available to identify sub-domain of a website?
3. Find IP address of your computer.
4. Download and configure different browsers on your system. Compare and contrast features.
5. Explore the concept of TCP/IP.
```

1. **Browse different websites and study their structure and layout.**
   This task involves visiting various websites to understand how they are designed and organized. Look for how navigation is structured, how content is laid out, and the overall user interface design.

2. **Explore the concepts of domain and subdomain. What options are available to identify subdomain of a website?**
   A domain is the unique name that identifies a website on the internet, like `example.com`. A subdomain is a second-level domain that is part of a larger domain, like `blog.example.com`. You can identify subdomains by looking at the URL or using online tools that list subdomains for a given domain.

3. **Find IP address of your computer.**
   Your computer's IP address is a unique identifier used to communicate with other devices on a network. To find it, you can use system tools like the Command Prompt on Windows (typing `ipconfig`) or the Terminal on macOS and Linux (typing `ifconfig` or `ip a`).

4. **Download and configure different browsers on your system. Compare and contrast features.**
   You can download different web browsers like Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, and Opera. Once installed, explore their settings, extensions, privacy options, and other features to understand the differences and similarities between them.

5. **Explore the concept of TCP/IP.**
   TCP/IP stands for Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol. It's a set of communication protocols used for the internet and similar networks. The TCP part manages the assembling of a message or file into smaller packets that are transmitted over the Internet and received by a TCP layer that reassembles the packets into the original message. The IP part handles the address part of each packet so that it gets to the right destination.


## Activity 2

```
Surf Internet and explore the components of different educational websites.
```

Here's a breakdown of what you might look for when completing this activity:

- **Content Quality:** Educational websites should offer accurate and valuable information on topics that support learning. This might include articles, videos, tutorials, and interactive lessons.

- **User Interface (UI):** The layout and design should be clean and straightforward, making it easy for users to navigate through the website and find the content they need.

- **User Experience (UX):** The site should provide a smooth and engaging experience for the user. This can be judged by how easy it is to interact with the website, how quickly pages load, and how the website guides the user through learning paths.

- **Interactivity:** Many educational sites include interactive elements like quizzes, tests, or games to enhance learning and retention.

- **Accessibility:** Good educational websites are designed so that all users, including those with disabilities, can access the content. This includes proper use of alt text for images, high contrast color schemes, and text-to-speech capabilities.

- **Multimedia Use:** Educational websites often incorporate various forms of media, such as text, audio, images, and video, to cater to different learning styles.

- **Mobile Responsiveness:** The website should work well on various devices, especially mobile phones and tablets, since many users may access the content on these devices.

- **Resources and Materials:** Many educational websites offer downloadable materials, like PDFs, PowerPoint slides, or other educational resources.

- **Community Features:** Some sites have forums, chat rooms, or comment sections where users can interact with each other and with educators.

- **Certification and Progress Tracking:** They may offer certificates of completion and track users' progress through courses or educational content.

- **Security:** Educational websites should protect user data with proper security measures, especially if they collect personal information or include a payment system for courses or materials.


## Activity 3

```
Browse some important websites available on Internet. Identify either they are static or dynamic.
```

Here's how you can distinguish between the two:

- **Static Websites** are those that serve the same content to every visitor from a fixed set of files. They do not require web programming or database design to function. Typically, static websites are created using HTML, CSS, and sometimes JavaScript that runs on the client side. They are not connected to a database and the content does not change unless manually updated by a webmaster.

- **Dynamic Websites** are interactive and capable of serving different content to users based on context, user inputs, or other factors. They generally use server-side programming languages like PHP, ASP.NET, or JavaScript running on the server (like Node.js). They often retrieve or write data to a database, and the content can change dynamically without the need for manual updates.

To identify whether a website is static or dynamic, consider the following:

- Does the content update regularly without manual intervention (e.g., news sites, social media platforms)? It's likely dynamic.
- Does the website offer user interaction, like login/logout functionality, profile management, comment sections, or forums? It's likely dynamic.
- Does the siteâ€™s URL end with extensions like `.php`, `.asp`, or does it include query parameters? This often indicates a dynamic site, though it's not a foolproof method.

Do note that today, the lines can be blurred because static site generators and advanced client-side scripting can make static websites appear dynamic. Also, some dynamic websites might cache their content and serve it in a static-like manner for performance benefits.

If you are looking to analyze specific websites, you would typically check for these signs or use developer tools in browsers to inspect network activity or the site's code for clues on whether it is static or dynamic.
