    <button onclick="incrementCounter()">Increment Counter</button>
    <p id="globalCounter">Global Counter: 0</p>

    <button onclick="calculateSquare()">Calculate Square</button>
    <input type="number" id="numberInput" placeholder="Enter a number">
    <p id="calculationResult"></p>

    <script>
        var counter = 0; // Global variable

        function incrementCounter() {
            counter++; // Increment the global variable
            document.getElementById("globalCounter").innerHTML = "Global Counter: " + counter;
        }

        function calculateSquare() {
            var number = document.getElementById("numberInput").value; // Local variable
            var square = number * number; // Another local variable
            document.getElementById("calculationResult").innerHTML = "Square of " + number + " is " + square;
        }
    </script>

<!-- 
In this example:

    Global Counter: We have a global variable counter that keeps track of how many times the "Increment Counter" button is clicked. Each click calls the incrementCounter function, which increments the counter by 1 and updates the displayed count. This demonstrates how a global variable (counter) can be accessed and modified from within a function.
    
    Calculate Square: When the user enters a number and clicks the "Calculate Square" button, the calculateSquare function is called. This function reads the user input (considered a local variable since it's retrieved within the function), calculates its square (another local variable), and then displays the result. This shows how local variables are used within a function to perform calculations or store temporary data.

This example further illustrates the distinction between global and local variables in JavaScript through interactive elements, providing a clear understanding of their scopes and behavior
